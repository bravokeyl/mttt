    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>True stories, even in a fictional form, have the power to grip you by the throat, furiously shake your body and then give you a parting kick in the arse. This is certainly true of stand-up comedian Richard Gadd\u2019s\u00a0<em>Baby Reindeer</em>, a blistering monologue which was first seen in Edinburgh this summer, and is now at the Bush Theatre in West London. Apparently based on his true experience with a female stalker, this is an obsessive story about obsession, and one which asks pertinent questions about what it means to be a victim, complicit or not, and how difficult it is to recover from trauma.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s six years or so ago, and young Gadd is working in a bar. One of the regulars is Martha, a fortysomething woman who claims to be a top legal eagle (with clients including David Cameron!), but never has any money on her. And spends far too long in the place without doing anything. Gadd feels sorry for her and thinks it\u2019s okay to flirt. After making a very ill-judged and inappropriately sexual joke, he finds that her interest in him becomes obsessive. She starts phoning and emailing him constantly, incontinently, and then starts turning up at his gigs. Her name for him is \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d. But because she never threatens him with violence, the police say that they are powerless to stop her.</p>\n<p>Sharing this Kafkaesque nightmare is Gadd\u2019s love interest, Teri, \u201ca Mediterranean, gender non-conformist, sexually fluid, politically active, trans woman.\u201d As Gadd struggles with his own feelings of sexual confusion, Teri is there to counsel him about Martha, who becomes more and more obsessive. More and more intrusive. What comes across strongly is how obsession can become contagious: Gadd finds that he cannot stop thinking about Martha, and that thoughts of her have taken over all of his waking hours. The victim becomes as contaminated by monomania as the stalker. Complicity is a mild word for it. And no legal redress is possible.</p>\n<p>As you\u2019d expect, Gadd writes this story with enormous passion and frightening intensity. He reproduces Martha\u2019s emails and voicemail messages, illustrating how \u201cshe would leap from sentence to sentence, each thought bounding onto the next, never pausing, never hesitating\u201d \u2014 which is also a great description of this one-man play\u2019s text, whose energy pulses unremittingly for the 75 minutes of the show\u2019s running time. There are glorious passages of grim hilarity, in-yer-face details of Martha\u2019s personal life and agonizing moments of Gadd\u2019s painfully, and very gradually, acquired self-knowledge. Like a psychological detective story, we finally find out exactly why Martha calls him \u201cBaby Reindeer.\u201d And it\u2019s so sad.</p>\n<p>On the way, Gadd recounts how Teri gave him a copy of Stefan Zweig\u2019s\u00a0<em>Beware of Pity</em>, a novel which shows how some people use kindness in a way that damages those around them. And themselves. Martha is soon exposed as an extremely needy and very disturbed individual, as much a victim of pathological circumstances as Gadd, whose own story of being groomed by a man while a student is disturbingly recounted. Amid all of this dark material, there are lashings of humor, and the show features visually stimulating projections of text, interviews with Gadd\u2019s friends and family, and blasts of music along with piercing rays of light. It\u2019s not all bleak.</p>\n<p>In Jon Brittain\u2019s lively production, Gadd leaps around the stage, his mental agitation mirrored by his physical movements. He relives the story with a mesmerizing stage presence. At times he is charming, or obviously fragile, and by the end on the verge of collapse: looking like a kind of Rodin sculpture of agonized masculinity. His performance is helped by designer Cecilia Carey, who creates an empty playing space with four boxes at its corners and a revolving circle in the center, a round space that draws in Gadd over and over again, as if the story\u2019s obsessive behavior is like a black maelstrom sucking the characters into its heart. Standing in for Martha is a cheap wooden bar stool. Apart from that, every aspect of the show is dark: words, motivations, story, and lighting. At times it\u2019s hard to follow the words because the rush of sound and lights is so overwhelming, but in general, the production is exciting as well as compelling.</p>\n<p>With its ethical questions (how much of one\u2019s life should one use in public performance?) and issues about personal behavior (how far should we use other people to overcome our own confusion?), this is a show with bite. And, just as Gadd\u2019s mind is colonized by his stalker in a bizarrely personal take on the Stockholm Syndrome, so it\u2019s hard to shake off the passionate vivacity of the play\u2019s content. On my way out of the theatre, I pass a young alcoholic taking shelter from the rain in the building\u2019s doorway. He apologizes for being in the way, and I am about to say something nice to him. Something friendly. But the words freeze on my lips. What if he misunderstands? What is he starts to stalk me? Oh, the appalling power of theatre.</p>\n<p>This article first appeared on <a href=\"http://www.sierz.co.uk\">sierz.co.uk</a> on 11 October 2019 and has been reposted with permission.

This project has been selected as the winner of this year\u2019s Ibsen Awards Festival Scholarship and will premiere later this year in Shanghai.\u00a0 In China, women who haven\u2019t married by the age of 25 are referred to as sheng nu. The term literally translates as \u201cleftover women\u201d \u2013 and such women are constantly trying to reconcile their personal desires with family and societal expectations.

Through his connection and a seed-funding from Ibsen International, we put together the entire team and started the project. We started a series of open-ended workshops to delve into the themes of the two chosen texts. From that starting point, we found our central focus: \u201cWhat is marriage\u2019s role in today\u2019s world? How can we renovate the institution of marriage</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so that it fits our personal vision?\u201d </span></p>\n<p><b>Selena: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn\u2019t mean that we all want to get married. We want to use marriage as a reflection of our anxieties and conflicts today. We realize that marriage is like a mirror that reflects the totality of all our anxieties. Often it is the conflicts between the institution&#8217;s expectations and our self-actualization. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lelia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anxiety is a key emotional touchstone of our project, from which we draw our key inquiries.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cuixi: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, it also reflects our country&#8217;s anxiety about the aging population which is passed on to our generation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shiya: Each of you has a distinct marital status. What does \u201cmarriage\u201d\u00a0 mean to you personally?</b></p>\n<p><b>Cuixi: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A family legacy. An obligation and a duty that a good daughter needs to fulfill.</span></p>\n<p><b>Lelia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a ritualization of a life-long commitment to building a family with someone. It came up many times in our workshops that marriage might simply be a legal identity, even though that might not be on a personal level.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Yangyang:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It\u2019s a commitment between two people who mutually want to be each other\u2019s life partner.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Yisha:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I\u2019ve been married for one year. I start to rethink about its meaning. I feel content and I don\u2019t need a certificate to be socially accepted.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Selena: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a lifestyle choice made at a particular moment.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Shiya: Indeed, marriage carries very diverse meanings for each individual. Are you seeking common ground in your project?</b></p>\n<p><b>Yangyang: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not trying to create a guidebook for the 21st-century marriage. Art should raise questions rather than providing one cohesive opinion otherwise it becomes propaganda. Through the process, we have been very open and supportive of each other, which makes it possible for us to share our family backgrounds and upbrings. By presenting all these differences and alternative ideas, we hope to inspire the audience to find a personal understanding that works for themselves.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Shiya: The 2019 International Ibsen Award Jury concluded that your new play \u201chas ambitions to embody the revolutionary spirit of these plays and to become a revolutionary feminist manifesto of our time. \u201d Do you think what you are creating is a form of a feminist manifesto?\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>All (laugh): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our first reaction to this jury award conclusion was: Oh my god, that is so much pressure! We discussed what \u201cfeminist manifesto\u201d means and found it a bit old-fashioned and also not specific enough. We want to go beyond a bold tagline and explore how social structures and frameworks become constraints to individuals.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Lelia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to explore how feminism confines and conflicts in our daily life and the things that we do which cannot be categorized as feminist actions. Simply walking out from the old system is not enough for us because we want to reconcile with the system on an individual level.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Yangyang: </b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Greatest Event in Life </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a representation of ideologies in the May Fourth Movement and running away from a traditional family for love does seem like a romantic idea for the writer at the time. However, we have moved on from ideologies and we want to investigate what does independence means for our generation.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Selena: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are inviting other women to join the conversations and revisit the legacies from the older generations.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Shiya: \u201cShanghai is a place of contradictions: a global megacity defined as much by capitalism as by communist ideals. An outward-looking attitude embracing foreign values and strong pride in its own identity fuse together, creating a unique cultural legacy known as Haipai.\u201d Your project proposal mentions that Shanghai is a source of inspiration. Can you explain how Shanghai influences your project?\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>Lelia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many aspects of living in Shanghai intrigues us: the city\u2019s capitalist reality, the multi-generational ways of engaging with the institution as well as it\u2019s multicultural and multilingual context.\u00a0</span><br />\n<b></b></p>\n<p><b>Shiya: Can you explain how the collective creation approach is practiced in your research and creative process?\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>Selena: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four of us will be on stage as characters to share our investigations and stories as well as our interview research. Each of us has a key inquiry of the topic and leads related researches and workshops, and then we deal with the collected materials together.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cuixi:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We come from very diverse artistic backgrounds. Lelia, Yisha, Yangyang come from more traditional text-based practices, Selena focuses more on documentary approaches and I do a lot of physical theatre. We share the same artistic vocabulary, at the same time we offer different angles to workshop our materials. Our research process echoes our interests and perspectives.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106806\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106806\" class=\"wp-image-106806 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Collage_Fotor_Fotor-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Collage_Fotor_Fotor-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Collage_Fotor_Fotor-300x300.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Collage_Fotor_Fotor-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106806\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of the Shanghai Propaganda Museum</p></div>\n<p><b>Shiya: What are your discoveries during your field trip at the Shanghai Propaganda Museum and the Marriage Market?\u00a0\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><b>Yisha: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our trip to the Shanghai Propaganda Museum gave us some insights on how women are portrayed in different eras for the government&#8217;s purposes or the consumer\u2019s interests. We became curious about how these images impacted women\u2019s perspectives on marriage and sense of self.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Yangyang: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wrote an honest ad for myself and the other collaborator went to the marriage market to \u201csell\u201d me. To my surprise, even though </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Greatest Event in Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was written 100 years ago, many issues such as the emphasis on superstition are still very present today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evaluation system of compatibility is updated so that factors such as income, education, housing status are all taken into account.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Selena: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through my interviews, I discovered that many women choose singlehood over marriage mainly because of economic reasons. Shanghai is such an expensive city to live and getting married often means sacrificing an individual\u2019s financial freedom.</span></p>\n<p><b>Shiya: Has your perception of marriage shifted since working on this project?</b></p>\n<p><b>Yangyang: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one workshop, we did the Hotseat Exercise, where the other collaborators asked me various questions. During this process, I made a breakthrough and realized that I do not need marriage to fulfill my desire of having children. I am not against marriage but the pressure of buying into the social construct is no longer there.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cuixi: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Realisation doesn\u2019t necessarily help because we have internalized so many of norms. As independent and educated young women of the 21st century, we understand marriage is not everything. Yet we ask ourselves again and again: how are we feeling right now?\u00a0 (laugh) We also question the idea of independence as capitalism enables us to outsource our problems so we have the illusion of being independent.</span></p>\n<p><b>Selena: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realized that I am defensive when it comes to marriage because it does not sit well with my pursuit of independence.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><b>Lelia</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: I got divorced before joining this project and this creative process helped me to get more clarity on my deepest longing, which is building a family.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106812\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106812\" class=\"wp-image-106812 size-full\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WechatIMG1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WechatIMG1.jpeg 800w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WechatIMG1-300x204.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106812\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo Courtesy of the ensemble.</p></div>\n<p><b>About the Collaborators\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selena LU has a BA in Politics, Psychology, and Sociology from Cambridge University and MFA in Theatre Directing from East 15 Acting School.

      "rendered": "<h4><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Political Self of Beauty</span></h4>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">South Korean artist Eunkyung Jeong\u2019s interdisciplinary work at TAZ#2019 recalls the structure versus agency debate in social sciences\u2014whether we are the product or disruptor of the society we grew up in and live in. But by yoking elements and strategies not immediately associable with one another (such as a flashlight, a basement, drawings, and personal family stories) she affects agency in relation to one\u2019s own place in cultural arrangements which frame one\u2019s choices and opportunities. This results in a refreshing and empowering artistic contribution to the debate.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">History is burdensome and, according to Jeong, it\u2019s dark. At the opening and closing of this performative installation, the artist lets each viewer probe the dark terrain of the basement in a building \u2013 situated in a food district of Ostend \u2013 with a flashlight given at the entrance of the show. The introductory and concluding parts where the viewers are turned into performers themselves are mediated by a video presentation on two screens. This changes the meaning of the second performative participation at the end.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The interplay between light and darkness accrues an interesting meaning when the flashlight brings into visibility the exquisitely rendered drawings of different destinies of a beautiful stone. The viewers have no idea what this stone embedded in different surroundings is or represents. Without the presence of the artist (which some viewers, misunderstanding that this is a performance rather than an installation, do ask for) the \u2018audience\u2019 is given a performative role of literally shedding light on each of the variations of the stone and its environments. One by one, navigating from one station to another where these drawings are placed on the floor, the viewers-turned-performers bring into being a seriality whose meaning pivots on the notion of identity: being same and different. (Both notions of agency and history and the exploration of the idea of &#8220;same and different&#8221; also interestingly inform the lecture-performances of her partner Jaha Koo who also contributes to this project as the sound and music designer.)</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The video that comes in between the performative acts of illuminating darkness charts the artist\u2019s personal history of her mother and herself, in a traditional extended Korean family. By referring to both herself and her mother identically as &#8220;she&#8221; and using &#8220;her&#8221; as the possessive pronoun for both, Jeong delicately suggests the continuity\u00a0</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">and\u00a0</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">inescapability of women\u2019s fate and their female subjectivity in the male-dominated Korean culture\u2014a thread that runs through from her mother to Jeong\u2019s generation. This is visible in the way the narrating artist, as a daughter, was named. As opposed to her brother whose name &#8220;Soo-ho&#8221; (a brave tiger protecting or governing a country) suggests action and agency, the name &#8220;Eunkyung&#8221; (shiny silver) she was given signifies how her family and society valorize her and her sex only in the realm of aesthetics: something beautiful to look at. The microcosm of this family history reveals a deep-seated sexual prejudice in a patriarchal culture where &#8220;male&#8221; is equated with active politics and &#8220;female&#8221; the kind of aesthetics that is passive.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The alluring narrative, thanks to the selection of music and visuals that accompany it, deceptively promises a way out when her mother tries to &#8220;escape&#8221; from the weary life of the housewife of a traditional Korean extended family by going to see a shaman. Ironically, the soothsayer further subjects her in another male-dominated narrative which adamantly reduces the role of woman as the mere supporter and reconfirms the role of men as the actor: &#8220;The\u00a0</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bong-Hwang</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0[referring to Jeong\u2019s mother] perch[es] on the tree [but] doesn\u2019t spread its wings [as it is supposed to].&#8221; The artist\u2019s attention to the translative process inherent in the shaman\u2019s narrative gives depth to this kind of all-too-familiar family anecdotes from Asia. Here, the symbolism of the mythical bird\u00a0</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bong-Hwang</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u2014which, in the East Asian culture, is king of all birds, hence symbol of high virtue\u2014is intentionally appropriated to keep women in the role of supporters of male family members who take action and prosper in the world\u2014a dichotomy of public and domestic life which also gets identified and challenged in the works of Western feminist writers such as Virginia Woolf. Although<em>\u00a0Self Life Drawing\u00a0</em>is culturally specific, this Korean experience is also identifiable to Westerners.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Amidst this locally-specific impasse where quiet &#8220;violence&#8221; against women is engineered in the language and culture one speaks and embeds oneself in, Jeong interestingly turns to the Western\u00a0</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">logos</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0and a particular way of thinking that comes with it. Unlike her mother, Jeong has the opportunity to live in the cultural imaginary &#8220;West.&#8221; Instead of going to a shaman, she finds salvation in linguistic activism: not only by imagining \u2018what if\u2019 her name draws on a more powerful and politically-engaged signified, but also drawing out and on the individualism underlying the Greek root of the word autobiography:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&#8220;From the ancient Greek, autos means SELF,</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Bios means LIFE and graphein means to WRITE or DRAW.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Auto-biography, a self-written account of the life of oneself.&#8221;\u00a0</span></em></p></blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At this point, the viewers/performers dawn on the meaning of what they have seen with their flashlights\u2014itself a metaphor for Enlightenment: the act of drawing as, not only a metaphor but a performative act of deciding for one\u2019s own life. Here is the point where this deceptively simple work redefines our usual understanding of the role of aesthetics in life. Dextrously weaving personal narratives in ways that ponder and respond to questions pertaining to sexual politics, Jeong in this beautiful work transforms aesthetics from something passive into something that has a promising political potentiality.</span></p>\n<p>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://e-tcetera.be/\">https://e-tcetera.be/</a> <u></u>on September 14, 2019.

      "rendered": "<p>Believe me when I tell you that there is much more to Alice Birch\u2019s play <a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/7193/blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>[BLANK]</em></a> than meets the eye. This is not only because Maria Aberg\u2019s production at the Donmar Warehouse selects and reorders 22 scenes out of the 100 in Birch\u2019s script, but because it fills in the \u201cblanks\u201d of the text (characters&#8217; names, genders, ages) in ways that construct certain narratives and eschew a great many others\u2014all of which are dormant in the play as it lives on the page.</p>\n<p>In her note to the script, Birch calls her method \u201ca challenge and an invitation\u201d for each producing team to make their own play. It is useful to remember that Caryl Churchill\u2019s <em>Love and Information</em> (2012) had a similar premise, though Birch\u2019s approach is admittedly more flexible, barely prescribing any rules. Hence, Aberg\u2019s all-female staging of this work creates a distinct play of its own\u2014one that centers Birch\u2019s scenes on the precarity of vulnerable, abused, and neglected women. <em>[BLANK] </em>was originally co-commissioned by the National Theatre and Clean Break, a leading theatre company working with women affected by the criminal justice system; so it is no wonder that the Donmar production, also co-produced by Clean Break, attempts to ground this self-consciously malleable play around this guiding concern.</p>\n<p>Mothers and daughters, sisters and friends, prisoners and guards are the characters that populate Aberg\u2019s take on the work. The 22 scenes vary widely in their setting, tone, and style, but common to many of them are shadowy references to abusive men, rejected pleas for help from other women, and attempts to escape oppressive realities. Birch\u2019s (and Aberg\u2019s) women are variously suffocated by the curveballs thrown at them\u2014from family, friends, or the state\u2014but they are also brave enough to ask for help, to reach outward, even though all these efforts prove tragically fruitless.</p>\n<p>Rosie Elnile\u2019s design places these numerous narratives on a two-storied set that resembles an abstracted, stripped-down cross-section of a house. The dominant colors of this scenography are sterile shades of blue and green, of the sort one would encounter in a depressing hospital. Jess Bernberg\u2019s brusque lighting (aided by fluorescent lights) and Carolyn Downing\u2019s ominously rhythmic sound design further turn this environment into a minefield of anxieties on the brink of combustion.</p>\n<p>Crucially, this is a minefield where explosions are often subdued but still devastating. A versatile and exceedingly strong cast of 14 embodies these diverse scenes with equal measures of variance and consistency. Those few actors whose characters recur in multiple scenes are especially good at giving us a convincing sense of the passage of time and change of circumstance. Every now and then, a deadpan style casts its unexpected shadow on some of the performances, but even then the ultimate effect turns out to be emotionally crippling. One can easily tell that every one of these actors has positively wrestled with Birch\u2019s charged, sly language.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_107494\" style=\"width: 1382px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107494\" class=\"wp-image-107494 size-full\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1372\" height=\"772\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-2-1.jpg 1372w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-2-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-2-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-107494\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The cast of <em>[BLANK]</em> at the Donmar Warehouse. Photo: Helen Maybanks</p></div>To a certain extent, however, Aberg\u2019s direction and dramaturgy overexploit the artistic license permitted by Birch\u2019s script: the shape of the production is frustratingly unpredictable and prone to half-baked digressions. While the piece begins with a succession of scenes that are separated clearly, it gradually becomes more fluid in how it brings these disparate parts together. Some of these subsequent transitions are accompanied by stylized choreographies, while others utilize projections of pre-recorded material. In some intimate scenes, the rest of the cast remains on stage too, each scattered to a corner and minding her own business\u2014as though they were all prisoners passing the time.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most troublingly, Aberg has decided to have a handful of characters recur in multiple scenes, while the actors playing those characters still appear in other scenes as other characters. Accordingly, the start of a new scene often triggers a sense of uncertainty about the nature of its relation to the whole: is this the continuation of something from before, or is it entirely new? Asking this question\u2014and looking for an answer\u2014does not make for the best use of one\u2019s time, and the production would have done well to establish clearer, more reliable rules of engagement for both structure and style.</p>\n<p>Despite these inconsistencies, Aberg\u2019s <em>[BLANK] </em>still boasts plenty of excellent moments. Chief among these are three spellbinding scenes: \u201cCarrier Bags\u201d is between two foster children (Zaris-Angel Hator and Taya Tower, both brilliant), one of whom militantly divides up their room to keep their stuff separate. \u201cTransference\u201d depicts a mother (an enchantingly restrained Thusitha Jayasundera) who receives the news of her daughter\u2019s prison suicide from a nervous social worker (Jemima Rooper). And finally, a magnificent, 45-minute \u201cDinner Party\u201d scene\u2014which is dazzling enough to be a play of its own\u2014features the whole cast in its relentlessly acerbic takedown of liberal hypocrisy.</p>\n<p>The titular party brings together a large group of female friends whose self-indulgent fictions of progress and empathy (about the #MeToo movement, among other issues) are shockingly exposed\u2014and exploded\u2014by a newcomer. Aberg\u2019s meticulous direction, including her haunting transition to the gnomic \u201cSmash\u201d scene, and the company\u2019s scalpel-sharp performances make this the obvious highlight of the evening, so much so that one can\u2019t fault the scene\u2019s considerable incongruence with the play proper. If only Aberg had concluded the production with this masterful centerpiece\u2026 (The two surprisingly bland scenes that follow upon it could easily be jettisoned.) It is worth seeing <em>[BLANK]</em> even if only for this nested tour de force of theatrical imagination.</p>\n<p>It bears noting, therefore, that Alice Birch\u2019s Churchillian experiments with form and language\u2014which were also evident in <em>Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again.</em> (2016) and <em>Anatomy of a Suicide</em> (2017)\u2014are an invaluable gift to theatre. In <em>[BLANK]</em>, her engrossing engagement with the semantics and ethics of intimacy and hostility, of privacy and collectivity, secures her name as one the most exciting voices of her generation. And for all its occasional pitfalls, Maria Aberg\u2019s production succeeds as an ambitious, handsome version of this endlessly playful play. At its best, it leaves one at once stunned and wide-awake.</p>\n",

What are your thoughts about the Festival and how did the idea of producing <em>The Village</em> at the Festival come about?\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p>Stan Lai [SL]: We\u2019ve been invited by the OzAsia Festival for the last couple of years. I met Joseph Mitchell, the artistic director of the Festival in Taipei and in Wuzhen Theatre Festival, which I help to administer. He was very keen to invite us to perform at the Festival. Last year, we did <em>Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land</em>, and I guess they enjoyed it so much that they invited <em>The Village</em> for this year.</p>\n<p><strong>MC: What can the Australian audiences expect from <em>The Village</em>? \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>SL: When we first staged <em>The Village</em> in Singapore, which was a year after we wrote the play, I was curious about how the Singapore audience would react to it. It ended up being a standing ovation and the Singaporeans never do that. They explained it is because they are also from an immigrant society.</p>\n<p>And I think this also holds true in Australia. I\u2019m not expecting any specific reception, but judging from last year for the production of <em>Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land</em>, I found the audience was amazingly in-tune with what was happening on stage despite the language barrier as we performed in Mandarin Chinese. Maybe we had 40-50% of Chinese audiences last year. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be like this year. But the non-Chinese audience, to my surprise, was extremely in-tune. And when we toured the United States in the past, the non-Chinese audience also tended to pick it up very well. I don\u2019t know what to expect [in Australia].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_107458\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107458\" class=\"wp-image-107458 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Village-show-image-4-OzAsia-2019-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-107458\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Village</em> by Stan Lai (Courtesy OZAsia Festival)</p></div>\n<p><strong>MC: A common feature of your plays is that they are always both entertaining and intellectual at the same time. Is this emphasis on being entertaining to the masses and intellectually-pleasing for the more serious, demanding audiences, something on your mind when you write your plays, including <em>The Village</em>? </strong></p>\n<p>SL: I don\u2019t think too much about the audience. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way but I don\u2019t consider too much of the audience when I write my plays. I\u2019m not considering how to please them. What I do for every project is different and so you try to create what is best with conditions of what the project has. And <em>The Village</em> project was so close to us in terms of their lives, the families, even the people we grew up with.</p>\n<p><em>The Village</em> is about the military independent villages in Taiwan and there is a sort of tradition to write about these villages in literature or documentary films, and they are always extremely bleak, not always pleasant and happy. When you have a bleak background, and you write everything very dark, then it will become very dark indeed. When you have a dark background and make light of these things, it changes the whole equation. Finding cheerfulness in a hopeless situation is one of the driving points behind the creation of the play.</p>\n<p>I remember showing some videos about half an hour of the play in Berkeley, and my old director Robert Goldsby came and saw them and then he hugged me and he called me Anton Chekov-esque. I wasn\u2019t really thinking about Chekov when I was writing <em>The Village</em> but now that I\u2019ve seen it probably a hundred times, there is definitely some Chekov there, and how you can make a scene funny or tragic with very small bits, it turns sad or turns funny. And I think that\u2019s how it goes throughout the three hours of <em>The Village</em>. And I think that\u2019s how people can relate to it because it\u2019s close to real life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_107462\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107462\" class=\"wp-image-107462 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Village-show-image-1-OzAsia-2019-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-107462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Village</em> by Stan Lai (Courtesy OZAsia Festival)</p></div>\n<p><strong>MC: There is always a historical element in your plays. Do you think there is a sense of responsibility in the back of your mind to do these histories and stories tastefully?</strong></p>\n<p>SL: For sure. Being tasteful is certainly part of the equation. When I was writing <em>The Village</em>, the most persistent thing that came to my mind was I had to get this right for the villagers. I want them to see this play and nod their heads and say \u201cYes this is how I experienced it.\u201d On the opening night, we got a standing ovation at the National Theatre of Taipei and it just went on and on. And everyone was very moved. My analytical mind kicked in: The audience, of course, is applauding the cast. But no, they are also applauding the characters of the story, these characters who survived. Later on, when I talked to people from the villages who came to see the play, they all emphatically said: \u201cYes this is the experience, thank you very much.\u201d And this is probably the most satisfying thing about directing this play.</p>\n<p><strong>MC: You\u2019ve also published a best-selling book on creativity called <em>Stan Lai On Creativity</em>. It is marketed and often received as a self-help book on how to tap into our inner creativity, for example, by dividing creativity into method and wisdom. Do you think this book can also help us understand your own artistic vision?</strong></p>\n<p>SL: If you are interested in how my mind works when I am writing, definitely that book is certainly a clue. But the book was not written for that purpose. The book, as you know, was not a collection of articles over the years. It\u2019s really purposely written to be a self-help book on creativity. I am actually in the process of writing an English version of the book. It will be a rewrite and not a translation of the Chinese version because it\u2019s going to be so different for a Western audience. In the Chinese version, I was comfortable in referencing my own works, which I wouldn\u2019t do in the English version because people in the West aren\u2019t that familiar with my work. It\u2019s not one of those \u201cA equals B\u201d things where you can find direct references to my work in that book. But it\u2019s an overall thing in that you get an idea of where my mind is at. In this sense, it helps you understand my work and how I write it.</p>\n<p><strong>MC: Whether it is your creative works, or your self-help book, or your personality in general, I get a consistent sense of this in-betweenness of popular and avant-garde. You are always able to talk about deep things in an accessible way. Is it a product of deliberate training or past experience? </strong></p>\n<p>SL: If you go back to the book on creativity, it deals a lot with motivation. Why are you an artist? Why do you write these things? For many artists, part of their motivation is to prove that they are at an intellectual or artistic level. But it\u2019s more to do with my Buddhist training which reminds us to keep an eye on our ego, whether you are successful or not. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m successful. But I am focussed on whether my ego expands too much. I just try to keep it simple and write a work that is worthy of our audience. I mentioned earlier I don\u2019t care about the audience. But, of course, we do. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t make what we think the audience would like. That\u2019s the Hollywood style and formula. But if you look closely at my work, a lot of it is a technical craft that resembles a lot of what Hollywood writers do too. You need the craft. But once you have the craft, what are you doing? What are you trying to achieve? It\u2019s all a question of motivation. Can you turn your motivation outside of yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>MC: A lot of your plays deal with painful and complicated political issues and historical events like the history of Taiwan and the Chinese civil war. Does this ego-checking mechanism help you present history in a more objective way? </strong></p>\n<p>SL: If you want to treat a period of history, you have to be respectful to it and do it right. Right and wrong in history, or like the military villages, are so subjective. But again, larger issues take over these concerns. You are writing a play to convey a message to the audience, and the history is just part of the vehicle that is being used to convey to the audience. The history is not the final goal. The play is not a thesis about the history of Taiwan. This is a play. Can the play enrich our understanding of history? That is more important for a writer. Our job is not to tell the audience what happened. Instead, can the play inform us about our journey from here on? Can we learn about the details that we didn\u2019t know before? Can we learn greater lessons? That is what theatre is about: For greater lessons to be shared for humanity.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-107465-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Video-The-Village-.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Video-The-Village-.mp4\">https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Video-The-Village-.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>MC: This indeed is why your plays are well-received around the world. But going back to the perspective you hold as you are writing your plays.\u2026. Do the labels of cultural identity like \u201cSinophone\u201d or national identities like \u201cTaiwanese\u201d or \u201cChinese\u201d shape how you write your plays? </strong></p>\n<p>SL: I often think labels are counterproductive. They are useful to quickly describe something that is not complicated. But I think my works are complicated. And to try to put a label on it, I don\u2019t think it will help. The current play I am working on in Shanghai called <em>Ago</em>, it deals with the Tibetan Plateau and New York. And then it goes to India. It\u2019s a long play that is similar to <em>A Dream Like a Dream </em>in its length and the way it\u2019s staged with the \u201clotus pond\u201d [the stage surrounds the audience]. In that way, that would defy the labels you want to put on me because it will be staged in Chinese but it was first written in English at Berkley. But I often analyze myself as being different from other playwrights because I have a dual perspective that comes from being bilingual and bicultural.</p>\n<p><strong>MC: A lot of critics have referred to you as \u201cthe greatest Chinese-language playwright\u201d of your generation or even ever. And now that you are 30-35 years into your career, are you concerned about how people see your work, and do you want to take a more active role in controlling the discourse around your work?</strong></p>\n<p>SL: My Buddhist training is always pulling at me and saying \u201cthe world and its history is so fickle, and don\u2019t even expect people to remember you after 20 years\u201d. And I really believe in that. I think that is a healthy way to look at it. With that said, I have been getting my things published in English and hopefully, that will happen next year. 10 plays will be published in English. Doing more work in the West means I think of myself as a bridge these days because there is so much misunderstanding between East and West. On the other hand, when we come to work, I want to narrow down the topic to \u201chow would I see other people who would direct my work?\u201d As an academic and an experimental artist for many years, I welcome any experiments with my work. But as I go along, I am more inclined to think: \u201cif you are going to direct my work and my plays, and you don\u2019t get it right, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d I keep telling myself and my students and my assistants to be aware of this point and that point.</p>\n<p>I am thinking of publishing two books of annotations of <em>Secret Lover Peach Blossom Land </em>and <em>A Dream Like A Dream</em>. The annotations will mostly be my comments or thoughts about how I would direct the plays. There will also be comments from all the actors that have performed in the play. It is in my mind for a couple of years and hopefully, we will be able to get these out. But there you see my worry about posterity: I am happy to have you do whatever you like with my plays, but I do want to let you know how, if done properly, how it would work. Because as you know, as a scholar, the big deal nowadays is deconstructing. Directors have been deconstructing for decades now. Last year, I did a version of Cao Yu\u2019s <em>Peking Man</em> but when I was doing it, I don\u2019t think anyone has ever done an orthodox version or definitive version. Like <em>Teahouse</em> you have a definitive version unless you are Meng Jinghui. But the audience really needs to know <em>Teahouse</em> in order to appreciate Meng\u2019s version. If you want to go wild with <em>Secret Lover Peach Blossom Land</em>, I\u2019d be very interested to see what people do with it.</p>\n<p>I was at Michigan this year, and we showed the film version of<em> Secret Lover Peach Blossom Land</em>. It\u2019s from 1992 and should be a real oldie, but it just feels very new. We came across something that lasts and in its uniqueness. If you want to be more unique, or try to out-unique it, by deconstructing it, I guess you will get less mileage than if you approached it with the proper sense. Take <em>The Village</em> as an example, every actor has its distinct voice and way of talking, and if you are a director who wants to direct this play, good luck to you because you have to know all the idiosyncrasies of the characters. But of course, that\u2019s what you should do as a director. So these things occupy my mind but not very much.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_107459\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107459\" class=\"wp-image-107459 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Village-show-image-3-OzAsia-2019-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-107459\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Village</em> by Stan Lai (Courtesy OZAsia Festival)</p></div>\n<p><strong>MC: This also touches on the issue of authorship because your plays, while the production is carefully crafted, the genesis of it is very collaborative, and involves the stories of multiple individuals. Just like how in <em>A Dream Like A Dream</em>, you need to know the stories of multiple individuals before you can really know a character\u2019s story. </strong></p>\n<p>SL\u201d There is a certain \u201cdepth,\u201d or \u201c<em>houdu</em>,\u201d which is there because of all the people who have worked with me. So maybe that\u2019s why it is a bit difficult for people to understand me. But actually, the most difficult part is the improvisational process. The word is used everywhere, and people think they know what I do, but I guess they don\u2019t. The older I get the more I realize it\u2019s very hard to teach my method of improvisation. People often think it is very hard to learn. It\u2019s very purpose-oriented with set parameters of scenes with characters. It\u2019s more and more like I am writing a play with the characters in front of me. That\u2019s very empowering for a writer because they are there and you have helped to build them and then you put them in situations where they interact with each other. And in many ways, they tell you how to write the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>MC: You\u2019ve worked very closely with theatre companies in Hong Kong, and you are very active in China too, like the Wuzhen Festival. Do you have any comments about the protests in Hong Kong right now?</strong></p>\n<p>SL: I don\u2019t live in Hong Kong, so I don\u2019t think I can speak about the protests. But we were rehearsing there when it first started. From the perspective of my work, you could imagine that if there were no protests in Hong Kong, a play like<em> A Dream Like A Dream </em>would be seen in a different light. The performance would be overshadowed by everything that\u2019s been happening. So for a while, I was pretty worried whether the audience was interested in coming to see my play. And apparently, they were. It makes me think again \u201cwhat\u2019s the role of arts in society?\u201d I really love Hong Kong, and Hong Kong has been wonderful to me. And I hope everything is well and people are safe.</p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Wow. Just wow. The moment you enter the auditorium of this venue it\u2019s immediately obvious that something special is going down. The stage is a grey circular platform which glitters a bit like the tarmac of a school playground on a sunny day, and three kids are already in action. One of them is conducting the drum \u2019n\u2019 bass soundtrack, another is chatting to audience members, and the third is asking you for a crisp, or a sweet. Their school uniforms are lovingly distressed. The music is loud. Real loud. This is how Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s <em>Little Baby Jesus</em> welcomes you\u2014and it\u2019s exhilarating.</p>\n<p>The show, which was first staged at the Ovalhouse in 2011, is a coming-of-age story about three kids in their last year of secondary school. Kehinde is a 16-year-old black teen who likes mixed-race girls and whose parents come from Nigeria; Joanne is slightly younger, a mixed-race \u201crude gal\u201d who comes from a troubled family; finally, Rugrat is the class clown, the type of boy who doesn\u2019t take a lead but likes to be close to the cool kids, even if they are bad boys. Kehinde also has a twin, Taiwo: he reckons that he is older than her because although she was born first, it was he that sent her out into the world. It\u2019s a typically quirky idea in a play that is full of them.</p>\n<p>Using a mix of monologue, dialogue and even passages of choral togetherness, Kene tells a tangle of stories about his characters. In one, Joanne gets pregnant with Baker, who Rugrat reckons is the dumbest boy in his year. What she does with the baby, once she goes to a countryside retreat to get away from the stresses of home and inner-city life, gives the play its allusive title. She is joined at this institution by Kehinde, and their friendship blooms in a rare moment of utter heartbreaking tenderness. In another story, Taiwo, who is sporty and fast, races Pierre, one of the fearsome Cali Road Boys, a contest that has violent repercussions.</p>\n<p>Among these main strands of narrative, Kene has included other stories, other scenes. One is a typically crazy after-school fight involving Babatunde, a muscular boy who was mocked for first turning up a school wearing sandals (another reference to Jesus). Then there\u2019s a richly comic sequence in a local launderette, where Joanne works along with Kristina, a Lithuanian girl. More troubling is the anecdote in which Kehinde\u2019s Grandma viciously attacks his older brother&#8217;s new girlfriend because she is a white girl. Race and gender are constants: the reason that white boy Pierre is antagonized by Taiwo\u2019s racing skills is that she is both female and black.</p>\n<p>Kene, whose one-man gig-theatre show <em>Misty</em> was a big hit last year, fires his verbal licks with enormous energy and brilliantly mixes laughter and sadness, embracing both the absurdities and the confusions of teen life with equal love. And it is love. The text has a vigorous life that would not be possible unless the playwright felt a real imaginative sympathy with his characters. For myself, I loved the imagery of magnetic attraction and sense of redemptive completeness. That said, some bits are easy to dislike: at times the storytelling is unfocused, with energy being preferred over clarity, and not everybody will admire the finger-wagging life lessons at the end of the piece. Sometimes the religious imagery, whether Christian (Adam and Eve) or Yoruba, feels forced.</p>\n<p>But what does it for me, what really hits the button is the production. Director Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu, who won this year\u2019s JMK award for young directors, creates a thumping, eye-popping event, part tall tale and part gig theatre, which is blissfully emotional and utterly enjoyable. He is well aided by Tara Usher\u2019s slick design, which features a halo of light above the playing space which seems to nod slowly in response to the action. At times, especially in the fresh and hilarious opening sequences, there is a miraculous feeling of wonder that radiates off the stage. As one actor tells a story the others act out its events, often in slow motion or using gestures to suggest some more ancient rituals or acts, as when the cawing of a crow is compared to the cock crow that heralds Peter\u2019s betrayal of Christ.</p>\n<p>And the acting is great. Anyebe Godwin lends Kehinde a calm and cool maturity that contrasts vividly with Khai Shaw, who plays the fool Rugrat as he tumbles across the stage, imparting a furious electricity to the action. Rachel Nwokoro matches the men perfectly, gesture for gesture and motor-mouth for motor-mouth; like them, she successfully conveys her character\u2019s vulnerability as well as her anger. All of them convey the na\u00efve wisdom of the street-smart teen, especially during the smaller moments of the play: the glimpse of a knife, some casual cruelty and the idea that growing up is achieved through experiencing random incidents. With its sensuous moves, pulsing energy and moments of rapture, this feels like the most exciting show on the London stage. Magnificent.</p>\n<p><em>Little Baby Jesus</em> is at the Orange Tree Theatre until November 16.</p>\n",

He had covered more than two thousand kilometers by foot. He began his journey in March, and in September he was arrested and sent for an official psychiatric exam. His journey appeared on social media, attracting millions of views. A criminal case has been opened against the shaman on charges of extremism. Later, Gabyshev informed his supporters that he was treated fairly and even \u201cmade friends\u201d with those who detained him. This is a strange story that provoked heated discussion in Russian society. The performance of the Olonkho Theatre also includes shamanistic rituals, but it is deprived of a political context. Therefore, it found its way to the audience without any barriers.</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"&quot;\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430&quot; \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 2018\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUvLptyPyYM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2018, the Olonkho show <a href=\"https://theatreolympics2019.com/en/events/warrior-ciribina/225\"><i>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</i></a> was nominated for the Golden Mask, the Russian National Theatre Award,&#8221; in several categories: Best Performance of a Drama, Large-Scale Production; Best Director; Best Scenic Artist; Best Costume Designer. The performance opened to the theatre public new pages of ethnic theatre and proved that tradition can be quite modern and in tune with the times.</span></p>\n<div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The play is based on one of the popular Yakut epics, or Olonkho (the theatre takes its name from the form), that is called the Northern Iliad or Yakut Odyssey. The plot could be well-suited for a fantasy blockbuster movie, however, this story about a woman warrior who was destined to fight the power of evil in an unequal battle. A cheerful girl is forced to take a sword to save her brother, his bride, and her own fianc\u00e9, but the struggle for loved ones turns into a struggle for all humanity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The virgin warrior is a powerful archetype that has existed as long as civilization itself. The image of a warrior maiden actively participating in the battle did not arise today, under the influence of feminist movements. Even in antiquity, people began to tire of the trope of the weak girl, waiting for a man to save her.

Olonkho is a large epic work comprising an average of seven to ten0 thousand poetic lines. According to one legend, the longest songs of Olonkho would take storytellers seven days and seven nights to relate, without a break!\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The ancient storytellers of Olonkho were akin to shamans. At times, they had neither a tambourine nor musical instruments\u2014 only a voice that they owned so skillfully that their listeners seemed to see the ancient heroes standing in front of them. Devoting all their time to training and improving their skills, storytellers usually wandered through different lands.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Olonkho, the ancient storytelling form, has been acclaimed by UNESCO as a masterpiece, part of the intangible\u00a0heritage of humanity.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106874\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106874\" class=\"wp-image-106874 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/462d5667d76e299a5373f1be7b130a32-dsc-0610-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot;\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/462d5667d76e299a5373f1be7b130a32-dsc-0610-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/462d5667d76e299a5373f1be7b130a32-dsc-0610-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/462d5667d76e299a5373f1be7b130a32-dsc-0610-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

They pay great attention to quality and reliability. Choreography and scenography are not just stylization, but a reference to the history and culture of Yakutia.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The director of <i>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</i>, <a href=\"https://theatreolympics2019.com/en/personalities/matrena-kornilova\">Matrena Kornilova</a>, contributed greatly to the study and popularization of Olonkho culture. The author of many successful productions, and an actress, researcher, and director of the Olonkho Theatre, Kornilova died in February 2019. The show at the Theatre Olympics has become a kind of dedication and tribute to her.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;We live in the Middle World between the Upper and the Lower ones. In Olonkho, as in the epos of other nations, the main narrative is about the light and dark beginnings of life and the responsibility bestowed on a human, not only for one&#8217;s actions but also for the state of the world. When evil enters the world from below, we become unkind and we have to resist it. Only then we can shape the fortune of our Middle World blessed by the gods,&#8221; said Matrena Kornilova.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106879\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106879\" class=\"size-large wp-image-106879\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d37c03d89f321add1c94c0b285226ca4-dsc-0982-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d37c03d89f321add1c94c0b285226ca4-dsc-0982-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d37c03d89f321add1c94c0b285226ca4-dsc-0982-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d37c03d89f321add1c94c0b285226ca4-dsc-0982-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106879\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

The first ones tell us about the creation of the Earth or the Middle World by the inhabitants of the Upper World\u2014good deities. Those in the second group speak about how exiles from the Upper World gave rise to the Yakut people. Those of the third group show hows the heroes of the Middle World (the world of people) were at enmity with evil demons from the Lower World. These demons struggled to exterminate people, or at least ruin their lives.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for the form of performance, there are two creative components in the Yakut epic: recitation and song. The first, on behalf of the narrator, is recited in a chant, its pace either slowing down or speeding up. The second, on behalf of the characters, is sung.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106877\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106877\" class=\"size-large wp-image-106877\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ca1f3cd61c3981bb83a51c48db12d9b0-dsc-0819-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot;\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ca1f3cd61c3981bb83a51c48db12d9b0-dsc-0819-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ca1f3cd61c3981bb83a51c48db12d9b0-dsc-0819-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ca1f3cd61c3981bb83a51c48db12d9b0-dsc-0819-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106877\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

The eighteen colorful episodes in the performance include amazing scenography, eye-catching costumes, and choreographic sketches where they jump, fly, and fight. The choreography is so original and evocative that people seemingly transform into birds or horses. By the way, the play uses real horsehair. This is not only a decoration but also an amulet of the performance. For the Yakuts, a horse is a deity protecting the world of people, the Middle World. It is said </span><span class=\"s2\">that the actors themselves participated in the creation of costumes and scenery, using the technique of ancient weaving.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106875\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106875\" class=\"wp-image-106875 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aa62b8cb257cd0c26b5c0ebcb44dc77d-dsc-0954-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot;\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aa62b8cb257cd0c26b5c0ebcb44dc77d-dsc-0954-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aa62b8cb257cd0c26b5c0ebcb44dc77d-dsc-0954-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aa62b8cb257cd0c26b5c0ebcb44dc77d-dsc-0954-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106875\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

At the same time, the performance does not seem dilapidated, divorced from modernity. It is bright and breathtaking thanks to their acting temperament, special Yakut singing, and original choreography. The performance team is well trained and acts as one harmonious unity. It seems that all gestures and movements are perfectly checked. However, this accuracy does not reduce the high emotional content. The strength of emotions, fury, and desperation pour from the stage into the hall. Cultural memory meets modernity here.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106881\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106881\" class=\"size-large wp-image-106881\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0ca63da3707026d07ad9ec618b662563-dsc-0780-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot; \" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0ca63da3707026d07ad9ec618b662563-dsc-0780-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0ca63da3707026d07ad9ec618b662563-dsc-0780-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0ca63da3707026d07ad9ec618b662563-dsc-0780-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106881\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

The battlefield is the soul of man.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The dance movements of the final scene are not a pure dance, but sacred movements that have been from ancient times through the Olonkho culture. Many gestures are sacred and mean protection or prayer. However, even a viewer that knows nothing about Olonkho can perceive the performance without translation or clarification. The performance speaks of eternal notions like good and evil, war and peace, and its language is multinational, transparent, and clear. Rich gestures emphasized notions, and foregrounded scenes grab the audience\u2019s attention. The beauty and mystery of what is happening can impress people of any age and background.</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"\u041d\u0410\u0423\u0420\u0423\u0417 2017 | 5 \u0418\u042e\u041d\u042f, 19.00 | \u0412\u041e\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u0418\u0426\u0410 - \u0414\u0416\u042b\u0420\u042b\u0411\u042b\u041d\u0410 | \u0422\u0415\u0410\u0422\u0420 \u041e\u041b\u041e\u041d\u0425\u041e (\u0420\u0415\u0421\u041f\u0423\u0411\u041b\u0418\u041a\u0410 \u0421\u0410\u0425\u0410 (\u042f\u041a\u0423\u0422\u0418\u042f))\" width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOAab6YhVng?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From the first moments, the whole action is permeated with national color\u2014 the viewer is immersed in the world of folk motifs and dances, ethnic symbolism and language, both shamanistic rites and folk instruments. This national color abounds, but the palette of the performance is well chosen and has an organic texture. The frantic energy of the actors and the light play capture the attention of the public. An enormous tambourine, in the middle of the stage, is a symbol of the sun. Not just a decorative element, it is the hero of the play. Also carrying symbolic weight are ropes (representing the river and the branches of a divine tree), with which the actors bizarrely interact. These ropes are the threads of fate, and the threads of the narrative, and the threads of life.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106885\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106885\" class=\"wp-image-106885 size-large\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12f76ff55b1c9ceb187c27e27bbc9362-dsc-0790-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot;\" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12f76ff55b1c9ceb187c27e27bbc9362-dsc-0790-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12f76ff55b1c9ceb187c27e27bbc9362-dsc-0790-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12f76ff55b1c9ceb187c27e27bbc9362-dsc-0790-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106885\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

Here you can search for theatrical language and rethink the ancient traditions, search for the opportunity to enter them into a modern context. Here, the plot of gods and heroes, singing, dancing, stage design, plasticity, rhythm, and acting are all fascinating. The Olonkho Theatre has certainly managed to gain originality and find its theatrical voice. All this suggests the need for the development and support of ethnic theatres in Russia. They are undeservedly forgotten or pushed into the background.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106883\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106883\" class=\"size-large wp-image-106883\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6a30ba15c64a80e902bf674275faa0c6-dsc-0750-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot; \" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6a30ba15c64a80e902bf674275faa0c6-dsc-0750-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6a30ba15c64a80e902bf674275faa0c6-dsc-0750-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6a30ba15c64a80e902bf674275faa0c6-dsc-0750-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106883\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.

Feminism comes to the fore here thanks to the bright heroine\u2013the girl-hero. When a man cannot take on some of the protection functions that nature has imposed on him, then the woman, rolling up her sleeves, must defend herself so that her loved ones, her house, and her land remain intact. It is curious that in the Yakut tradition all rivers bear female names. The river is violent and indomitable, but at the same time water is a feminine element that has memory and gives life.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106882\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106882\" class=\"size-large wp-image-106882\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3e4b6c4fa9a4d18de54d42cac6c7f1c4-dsc-0466-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot; \" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3e4b6c4fa9a4d18de54d42cac6c7f1c4-dsc-0466-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3e4b6c4fa9a4d18de54d42cac6c7f1c4-dsc-0466-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3e4b6c4fa9a4d18de54d42cac6c7f1c4-dsc-0466-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106882\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman</em>.&#8221;Director Matrena Kornilova.

Here, dreams and fairy tales gain the power of reality, and reality is drawn up by bizarre patterns of unique Yakut craftswomen. The Olonkho Theatre convincingly proves that the Yakut epic is alive and not divorced from modern life. Olonkho has become both a way of understanding and a reflection of the world, the beauty of which is in its diversity and the truth of sincere, not playful, and not theatrical emotions. Authenticity, like the element of water, is the purifying power of the play.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_106880\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106880\" class=\"size-large wp-image-106880\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/e0b1ffad5d324a871fc75f6819b2f11b-dsc-0496-resize-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.&quot; \" width=\"1024\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/e0b1ffad5d324a871fc75f6819b2f11b-dsc-0496-resize-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/e0b1ffad5d324a871fc75f6819b2f11b-dsc-0496-resize-300x178.jpg 300w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/e0b1ffad5d324a871fc75f6819b2f11b-dsc-0496-resize.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-106880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dzhyrybyna the Warrior Woman.

    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Students and early career dramaturgs were invited to The John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington DC from 27th July to 4th August 2019 to participate in the 8<sup>th\u00a0</sup>New Play Dramaturgy Intensive. This masterclass, led by dramaturg Mark Bly, was created in 2011 through a partnership between the Kennedy Center, the Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas (LMDA) and the National New Play Network (NNPN). The goal of this annual Dramaturgy Intensive is to provide new and emerging dramaturgs with a firsthand opportunity to learn how to be a key resource in the rehearsal room to both the playwright and the director. During the eight days of the Intensive, participants were invited to witness a series of workshops developing new plays, as well as participate in discussions with eminent American dramaturgs.</p>\n<p>The core aspect of the Intensive revolves around the plays in development. This year there were eight plays being workshopped, and the end of the program culminated in staged readings of these texts. The plays were selected through another program, The MFA Playwrights\u2019 Workshop. This workshop was founded in 2006 and invites each year up to eight MFA student playwrights from seventy participating universities to come to the Kennedy Center and see their plays developed by a team of professionals. The Dramaturgy Intensive now runs adjacent to this program.</p>\n<p>Participants in the Dramaturgy Intensive this year were allocated to one of the eight plays that aligned with their personal interests, previous research, and experience. They were under the care of a mentor dramaturg and acted as this mentor\u2019s assistant dramaturgs.</p>\n<p>Each play was unique, but overall themes of religion, race, identity, and heritage prevailed throughout. The plays were at various stages of completion. While some playwrights brought a near-finished play, others arrived with only research and no script. This inevitably made the work in every rehearsal room very different, and the dramaturgy of each room varied extensively.</p>\n<p>The teams in every rehearsal room were composed of a number of professionals. In addition to the mentor dramaturg, the assistant dramaturgs, and the playwright, there were also a host of actors invited to bring the text to life, a director, an assistant director, and a stage manager. The playwrights also had the possibility to request further professionals if necessary. Accordingly, one rehearsal room invited a movement director and another had a sound designer present. This setting allowed assistant dramaturgs to not only benefit from the presence of a more experienced mentor dramaturg but also witness, in some cases for the first time, the inner mechanics of a professional rehearsal room.</p>\n<p>I was assigned to Charly Evon Simpson\u2019s new play, <em>Sandblasted. </em>The director was Summer L. Williams, and the lead dramaturg was Jacqueline E. Lawton. There were two other assistant dramaturgs in this rehearsal room.</p>\n<p>The most exciting aspect of the rehearsal process for me was to witness the script development. Before the intensive began, I was sent a first draft, which was 45 pages long. Throughout the five days of the developmental process, I saw the script grow from 45 pages to 120 pages. This came about in response to the rehearsal room discussions that highlighted key points in the world of the play that could be developed.</p>\n<p>For example, the first draft had three male characters: the protagonist\u2019s brother, a bartender, and an ex-boyfriend. During the working process, the playwright discovered that the brother was in fact also the bartender. This added an extra dimension, not only to the character but also to the world of the play, which showed how the lives of all the people in the play interwove one with another.</p>\n<p>While the assistant dramaturgs\u2019 involvement in the rehearsal rooms was different, my experience (and that of the two other assistant dramaturgs) in this particular rehearsal room was mostly one of observation. We were asked only a couple of times to voice our thoughts in the rehearsal room. Mostly, we communicated directly with our mentor dramaturg, Jacqueline, outside the rehearsal room via email. Each assistant dramaturg was asked to provide a list of questions (or comments) about the play, its characters, and the world the play was set in. These questions were then related back to the playwright through Jacqueline. We were also able to ask questions or simply discuss dramaturgy with Jacqueline.</p>\n<p>The final two days of the Intensive saw all the practitioners come together to watch staged readings of the plays we had been working to develop. Most plays were presented at nearly fully completed versions of the text and we were only asked to witness the readings. There were short discussions after two plays only, <em>Oh to Be Pure Again\u00a0</em>by Kira Rockwell and <em>Untitled TMT Play\u00a0</em>by Susan Stanton.</p>\n<p>In addition to the work in the rehearsal room, every day we participated in discussions (led by Mark Bly) with invited dramaturgs, such as Gavin Witt, Lauren Halvorsen, Deanie Vallone, Adrien-Alice Hansel, Jacqueline E. Lawton, and Jacqueline Dias.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_107669\" style=\"width: 1510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107669\" class=\"wp-image-107669 size-full\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Photography-Teresa-Castracane-e1571945490542.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-107669\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Teresa Castracene.</p></div>\n<p>Gavin Witt, associate director, and dramaturg at Baltimore Center Stage was also a mentor dramaturg on one of the plays in development (<em>Miku and The Gods </em>by Julia Izumi). He balanced the conversation between sharing his own experience working in theatre, cultivating a career as a dramaturg, and answering any question the participants were keen to ask.</p>\n<p>Jacqueline Lawton, who works as a freelance dramaturg and playwright, focused her discussion on dramaturgical identity in a rehearsal room. She discussed questions of race and identity within a rehearsal room, how to navigate these questions, and how each dramaturg brings their own experience into the room, which is valid in and of itself.</p>\n<p>Jacqueline Dias conducted a decolonizing workshop. This workshop looked at how theatre practitioners can refocus their practice to be more mindful of addressing communities at their roots. It also raised questions about problematic structures within theatres that exclude certain people or heritage. This was illuminating to me because I had not realized before that we can be potentially at risk of participating in these problematic structures or perpetuating pre-existing structures without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>Finally, discussions with Mark Bly allowed us to gain an understanding of his rich experience as a dramaturg. He also talked about what to expect working in the field, and emphasized, how important it is to observe a rehearsal room, to listen, and to ask more questions than give answers.</p>\n<p>The combination of these talks with the experience of workshopping plays in development was of value to me as an early career dramaturg. I found useful not only the talks and discovering more of the rehearsal process, but also valued the ability to meet other dramaturgs at various stages of their careers.</p>\n<p>The Intensive did not, however, allow every assistant dramaturg the same opportunity to develop their skills. Other assistant dramaturgs in other rehearsal rooms were active participants in the dramaturgy of their assigned projects. Yet, I found that in my rehearsal room, the assistant dramaturgs were somewhat silenced, as our role was to listen and observe only. This left me feeling a bit frustrated as my experience became one purely of observation, where I was able to learn but not contribute actively to the overall project. Perhaps there is space in the Intensive\u2019s future versions to achieve a better balance between the passivity of witnessing the work and an active participation in the rehearsal space.</p>\n<p>The Dramaturgy Intensive had a steep learning curve for all of us, but it was especially intensive for an international participant, such as myself, a Swiss national based in London. I quickly had to assimilate American culture and reference points both in the plays presented as well as during rehearsals. Yet, the overall experience was invaluable as it allowed emerging dramaturgs the chance to experience the rehearsal process in one of the top American institutions as well as learn from leading practitioners in the United States.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_107668\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107668\" class=\"wp-image-107668 size-full\" src=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0-3.jpeg 640w, https://thetheatretimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0-3-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-107668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Jackie Mass.</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Elizabeth Leemann\u00a0</strong>works as a dramaturg, playwright and assistant director for a number of theatre companies and cinema production companies in and around London, including KDC Theatre, Vulpine, Persever Productions, flashpoint collective, and The Weaver Productions in York.

      "rendered": "<p>\u201cOur family doesn\u2019t get on,\u201d sneers the eponymous matriarch of Maxim Gorky\u2019s <a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/vassa/7-oct-2019-23-nov-2019#open-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Vassa</em></a>, now playing at the Almeida Theatre in an adaptation by Mike Bartlett. Uttered towards the end of the play, Vassa\u2019s declaration is a belated understatement of how the members of her dysfunctional family spend most of their time bickering with one other, plotting feeble stratagems, and eavesdropping behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>With her husband on his deathbed, Vassa is not only responsible for arranging matters of the inheritance among her three adult children, but intent on brushing up their extended family under the guise of \u201cguarding the house.\u201d Before long, moral qualms go out the window, and manipulative expediency takes over. \u201cChildren make laws,\u201d Vassa explains matter-of-factly, \u201cgrown-ups make deals.\u201d But in her deals, she appears to be the only winner.</p>\n<p>Directed by Tinuke Craig with baffling looseness, Bartlett\u2019s free-floating adaptation of Gorky\u2019s <em>Vassa Zheleznova</em> (originally published in 1910 but first performed in 1936) begins with projected statements that situate the work in its pre-revolutionary setting. But just as Bartlett\u2019s title drops the matriarch\u2019s last name, his adaptation gets rid of nearly every detail that would anchor this play in a specific historical context. Both Fly Davis\u2019s wooden-paneled set and Lisa Aitken\u2019s quasi-contemporary costumes distance <em>Vassa</em> from any attempt at capturing the atmosphere of an early twentieth-century narrative. Anything goes in this production, and this indiscriminate aesthetic extends well into Craig\u2019s considerably undercooked direction, as well as the cast\u2019s haphazardly modulated performances.</p>\n<p>Caught in a destructive orbit around the domineering figure of Vassa, many of the play\u2019s colorfully edgy characters are part of one big family. But there is very little in Craig\u2019s production to make you believe so. The problems have to do both with the chemistry among her actors and with the pronounced differences in their registers of performance. Neither the siblings nor the married couples reveal anything of the knotty dynamics that such relations would carry, no matter how estranged or disagreeable the parties may be.</p>\n<p>This is not necessarily to criticize individual performers in their own right: rather, the production boasts some strong performances, particularly by Arthur Hughes (the disparaged son Pavel), Amber James (the steely daughter Anna), and Danny Kirane (the acerbically easygoing Semyon, Pavel\u2019s older brother). Siobh\u00e1n Redmond\u2019s Vassa alternates decently between shades of ruthlessness and sincerity, and Kayla Meikle delivers some memorably belligerent moments as her outspoken daughter-in-law. This is all fine, except that each of these performances belongs to a separate production; their wavelengths do not mesh symphonically. When the actors come together on stage, what we see is much more a medley of quirky strangers than a problematic family.</p>\n<p>Add to this a number of inexplicably stylized moments in an otherwise realistic staging, along with some awkward changes in lighting, and you have a production whose coherent aspects turn out to be its outliers. Complicit in creating this off-kilter effect is a sleekly claustrophobic design that would be far more fitting for a corporate drama (think HBO\u2019s <em>Succession</em>). Presented with this formal-looking and largely bare interior, where family pictures are crammed into a corner, one should not be blamed for forgetting that the play takes place in a family home, rather than a high-up office.</p>\n<p>There are some engaging moments, especially near the end, where the rhythm of filial confrontations picks up real steam, making one feel the sharp, corrosive edges of this family\u2019s internal hostilities. Elsewhere, the vacuous volatilities of this middling production are plentiful, but when such meaty encounters flare, they pull you back into Gorky\u2019s complex vision of a family\u2014and a nation\u2014headed to ruin.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Adaptation is too banal a word to describe the cross-fertilization of theatre and other art forms. Sometimes stage versions of familiar books are more like radical reimaginings that anything that might be described as a faithful reproduction. And so it should be. One example is Laura Wade\u2019s\u00a0<em>The Watsons</em>\u00a0at the Menier Chocolate Factory, which is so much more than just a standard Jane Austen adaptation, and also more than just a meta-theatrical satire. Another example is French playwright and poet Samuel Gallet\u2019s recent play,\u00a0<em>Mephisto [A Rahpsody]</em>, which takes as its basis Klaus Mann\u2019s 1936 novel,\u00a0<em>Mephisto</em>. He was the son of novelist Thomas Mann, and once worked as a drama critic in Berlin, but left Germany when the Nazis came to power; <em>Mephisto</em>\u00a0was written in exile in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>Gallet\u2019s\u00a0<em>Mephisto [A Rhapsody]</em> has a similar starting point to that of Mann\u2019s novel. The setting is the local theatre of the small provincial town of Balbek, and the story centers on Aymeric, a volatile actor who dreams of becoming a celebrity. While the artistic director of the company, Eva, wants to stage a revival of Chekhov\u2019s\u00a0<em>Cherry Orchard</em>, the younger actors, such as Luca, Nicole, and the newly arrived Barbara, who is the daughter of the celebrated theatre-maker Anna, advocate a more political theatre: the extreme right is on the rise, and they want to combat it. However, Michael, another actor, is a young working-class man drawn towards the rightist party. Locally, Fabien is the new mayor, and of course, he also is on the right. But, while political violence escalates, Aymeric decides to quit Balbek and try his luck in the big city.</p>\n<p>Those familiar with Mann\u2019s novel will know what happens next. And it doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out that for the narcissistic Aymeric success is much more attractive than political engagement. Along the way, we watch as he seduces Barbara, then abandons her when he hits the big time, and how his obsession with starring in\u00a0<em>Hamlet</em> chimes in with Fabien\u2019s desire to provide culture to the masses. There\u2019s a kind of ghastly inevitability about the story, and about the rise of the right in Europe. As a counterpoint to the groundswell of prejudice, the theatres in the play are little islands of sanctuary from the pervading madness. One character, Juliette Demba the black cabaret singer, symbolizes a more tolerant society.</p>\n<p>Gallet organises his drama into six sections, which each have evocative names (from the opening \u201cA Long Way Away from the Big City\u201d to the concluding \u201cElsinore\u201d, in which Hamlet\u2019s meditations on suicide and death are juxtaposed with the final minutes of Klaus Mann\u2019s existence, as he ends his own life in 1949). The rapid escalation of events, punctuated by meta-theatrical moments which feature, for example, Marber the theatre critic, has a good forward movement and Gallet further punctuates the action by giving most of his characters a set-piece monologue. There are strong moments, as when Michael is confronted by Barbara for recording a piece of hate speech, which effectively escalates the action.</p>\n<p>But as a piece of writing, Gallet\u2019s play is not problem-free. Unlike the original <em>Mephisto</em>, or indeed Eugene Ionesco\u2019s\u00a0<em>Rhinoceros</em> or Albert Camus\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sierz.co.uk/reviews/the-plague-arcola-theatre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Plague</em></a>, I think the piece lacks a powerful central metaphor: Aymeric\u2019s embrace of Hamlet somehow doesn\u2019t do it for me. Although the introduction of pigs\u2019 heads has potential as a metaphor, it is never really exploited. The final two scenes, which feature historical characters from German culture and Mann himself, feel redundant to me, and the use of the word \u201cfascist\u201d to describe the sickness overtaking Europe, instead of, say, far-right populism or authoritarianism, seems exaggerated and therefore too easy to ignore. The whole gesture is too obvious, too clich\u00e9d even.</p>\n<p>That said, there is much to enjoy in Kirsty Housley\u2019s often compelling production, which is distinguished by episodes of pleasurably wild abandon, despite the occasional wobble when the stage picture looks awkward. Her designer Basia Binkowska creates a long narrow playing space, with shiny vulgar gold curtains and a long mirror that reflects the audience back on itself. The translation, by Chris Campbell (ex-Royal Court), is both colloquial and formal, as well as eminently playable, with Anna-Maria Nabirye, who plays Juliette Demba, given an extra speech which pertinently addresses racism in casting and forces us to question what we are watching.</p>\n<p>Best of all is Leo Bill, who inhabits the character of Aymeric with an intense ferocity that is both thrilling and disturbing. In a bravura performance, his character climbs his way to the top by any means necessary, and we are both fascinated and repelled. He is well supported by Elizabeth Chan and Subika Anwar-Khan as Luca and Nicole, Rebecca Humphries as Barbara, with Tamzin Griffin (Eva/Anna) and Sean Jackson (Fabien/Marber) playing two roles, while Rhys Rusbatch\u2019s Michael and Nabirye\u2019s Juliette are both excellent. In the end, I wish that the meta-theatrical side of the evening was less pronounced than the central story of celebrity versus commitment.</p>\n<p>This article originally appeared on sierz.co.uk on 10 October 2019 and has been reposted with permission. <a href=\"http://www.sierz.co.uk/reviews/mephisto-a-rhapsody-gate-theatre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the original article here.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
